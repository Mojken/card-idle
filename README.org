* Card Idle
Card idle is an incremental game inspired by trading card games. You open
booster packs to get some random cards, and you select a few of these to hold in
your hand, where they have some effect. The most basic effect would be to
generate some resource, and the first card you get would generate the resource
you need to open more booster packs.
